So this is a Restaurant tip calulator. 
It uses html/css and javascript. 
The code for the project is in the above files.
It asks for how much was your bill, how was your service and how much people are sharing the bill.
After that it usues javascript at the backend to calculate the tip that each individual should pay.
NOTE: A calculator that allows customers to input their total bill, including tax and gratuity, and then see how much they would like to tip on top of that amount.
